# Spatial Modelling of COVID-19 Lockdown Strategies for University Campus - a Case Study for Storrs Campus Community, University of Connecticut

## Abstract
In the United States, the number of cases of the COVID-19 is increasing constantly. After a few months of the lockdown in March, most of the states are reopening, including retail stores, restaurants, and recreation. As for  university or college, COVID-19 is affecting normal university affairs and residential student life. Most of the classes at the universities have been moving online or distance learning to prevent spreading of the disease. Recently many universities have announced lockdown or reopen business strategies at a large region (such as at the county or country level)in literature, there are few studies to evaluate lockdown or reopen strategies at a specific location such as at the university campus level.

 University of Connecticut (UConn) is a public land-grant research university in Storrs, Connecticut.  located in the northeast of the United States, the temperature is low during the fall and winter. It has totally about 40,000 students. Currently approximately 5,000 students are living on campus. Students and the university need to ening policies. 

In this study, we focus on extending a mathematical model, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to estimate the Covid-19 infectious rate and recovery rate at the Storrs campus of University of Connecticut (UConn), which is a public land grant research university located in the northeast of the United State. After finding out the parameters using SIR, we use the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to simulate different cases to predict and evaluate the risks of different places on campus. Our primary goal is to extend the SIR model into the spatial form and using QGIS and NetLogo to visualize the spreading. Three scenarios are created based on varying restrictions. 

### Baseline Scenario
The baseline scheme means that all restrictions will be enforced.

### Case 2
The second scenario is obtained by implementing 50% of its regular indoor capacity.

### Case 3
The third scenario follows the Phase 3 Reopen Rules by Sector in Connecticut, which is 50% capacity of religious gatherings, and 75% indoor capacity of restaurants.
